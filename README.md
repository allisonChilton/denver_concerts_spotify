# Upcoming Denver Concerts

Maintains two playlists for spotify based on upcoming concerts in Denver. The cheap playlist includes concerts from the Bluebird, Gothic, and Ogden Theaters, and the Fillmore Auditorium. The expensive playlist includes concerts at Red Rocks and the Pepsi Center.

Expensive Playlist: [https://open.spotify.com/user/alliechil/playlist/5PpYDD3feYK9jxaHDirhKI?si=EJ3XRSj8Slu4606RO1GaDQ]

The playlist updates once a day and drops off concerts that have already happened, as well as add any new ones that it can find on Westword.

Generally speaking, the list is ordered by soonest concerts first. I make no guarantees of accuracy or bug-free software. See license for details.
